## Features (In-Depth) ‚ú®

### üîç Large Language Model (LLM) Integration

Uses **nvidia/Mistral-NeMo-Minitron-8B-Instruct** from Hugging Face to provide advanced text generation, resulting in high-quality data that can be tailored to multiple domains such as bioinformatics, finance, and education. This model offers robust and contextually relevant responses, making it ideal for generating synthetic data for various applications.

### üß† Gradient Checkpointing

Implements gradient checkpointing to minimize GPU memory usage during the text generation process, making it possible to use larger models even with limited hardware resources. This allows users to perform efficient model inference without running into memory issues, especially on GPUs with smaller memory capacities.

### üìä Batch Processing

Efficiently processes and writes dataset rows to CSV files in batches, reducing the overhead associated with file I/O operations and improving overall performance. Batch processing helps in handling large datasets seamlessly, making the data generation process faster and more resource-efficient.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables Customization

Allows easy customization of model parameters, cache directories, and other settings through a `.env` file, offering flexibility in how the script is run. Users can easily change model names, output file paths, and other configurations without modifying the core script, ensuring adaptability for different projects.

### üìù Customizable Prompt Templates

The prompt templates used to generate the dataset can be easily customized to suit different domains such as finance, education, or genomics, allowing the generator to adapt to a wide range of applications. Users can modify the prompts to generate more domain-specific responses, providing better relevance for specialized use cases.

### üåç Multi-Domain Flexibility

The script can generate synthetic data for a variety of domains. This flexibility makes it suitable for applications in finance, education, healthcare, and more, based on user customization of prompts and contexts. Whether it's creating educational content or generating financial insights, the script can be tailored to meet specific needs.

### ‚ö° Command Line Integration

Users can pass environment variables directly via the command line to override `.env` settings, making it easy to adapt configurations without editing the file. This feature is ideal for quick testing, deployment, or running multiple configurations in different environments without making persistent changes to the codebase.

### üíæ CPU Offloading Support

Supports CPU offloading to manage memory usage effectively when GPU resources are limited. This feature allows users to offload parts of the model or its computations to the CPU, enabling the use of large models on systems with constrained GPU memory.

### üîÑ Retry Mechanism for API Calls

Implements a retry mechanism using the `backoff` library to handle transient errors during model loading or data generation. This ensures that the script can recover from temporary issues, providing a more reliable data generation process.

### üß† Gradient Checkpointing

Implements gradient checkpointing to minimize GPU memory usage during the text generation process, making it possible to use larger models even with limited hardware resources.

### Environment Variables üå±

The script uses a `.env` file to manage configurations:

- **`.env`**\*\* File\*\*: Contains default settings for the model name, cache directory, number of rows to generate, and output file name.
  - Example `.env` file:
- **Alternative Methods**: You can also pass environment variables directly in the command line before running the script:

### Customizing Prompts for Different Subjects ‚ú®

The script can be easily customized to generate data for different subjects, such as finance, education, or genomics. Here‚Äôs how you can modify it:

1. **Edit Prompt Templates**: Locate the part of the script where the system prompt and user prompt are defined (usually in the `generate_prompt()` function). Update these prompts to reflect the subject area you want to generate data for.
   - For example, change "You are an expert in bioinformatics..." to "You are an expert in finance..." for generating finance-related datasets. Locate the part of the script where the system prompt and user prompt are defined. Update these prompts to reflect the subject area you want to generate data for.
   - For example, change `"You are an expert in bioinformatics..."` to `"You are an expert in finance..."` for generating finance-related datasets.
2. **Modify Context and Columns**: Update the context generation and column names to suit the specific subject you are targeting. For instance, in the CSV file, replace columns like `suggested_tools_software` with more appropriate categories such as `financial_metrics` or `educational_resources`.
3. **Update ********************`.env`******************** File**: Modify the `.env` file to use different models if needed, or adjust the number of rows and output file names based on your requirements.
